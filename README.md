Data_Vis

Goal of this project for now is to have a function take a data structure and let the user apply their choice of visualization to the dataset and save plots and data to file.

data_vis.py outside of the main data_vis function just has a temporary Python list defined and the function call with the list as the argument. If integrated into a GUI, the function could be called with a button press, taking the argument from user input (ex: from a data structure in memory or a saved csv/text file)
